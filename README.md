# fullstack-react-blog
A fullstack blog implemented in React+Redux with Express and PostgreSQL.

## Overview

This project is my personal React.js sandbox/playground for building a fullstack web application. Here, I apply or experiment with some of the insights I gain from coding with various React+Redux, Express, and PostgreSQL libraries in the industry. I've worked and tinkered with several libraries such as Material-UI's comprehensive UI component library (https://material-ui.com/), middlewares like Redux-Saga (https://redux-saga.js.org/) and Redux-Thunk (https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk), and other complementary libraries such as Reselect (https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect) and Immer (https://github.com/immerjs/immer).

This particular project uses Auth0 (https://auth0.com/) for a streamlined login solution.

## Commit Format
